## gseasonality - Genetics of seasonality <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="140" />

This software package enables assessing the role of genetics in seasonal disease risk. In other words, assessing whether genetic variants are associated with a tendency to be diagnosed with a disease at a certain time of year. There are two main functions in the package: 

```seasonality_gam ``` - Infers the seasonality model using disease diagnosis dates

```get_seasonality_phenotype ``` - Assigns a seasonality phenotype to each individual based on the seasonality model.

## Installation
If you are connected to internet, the package can be installed by writing
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("sor16/gseasonality")
```
For an environment not connected to internet, download a zip file of the package, ship it to your environment and write in the RStudio console:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_local('path/to/package/zip/file',type='source',repos=NULL)
```


## Getting started
The gseasonality package is easy to use. The first step is to fit the seasonality model. It comes with a simulated data set ```diagnosis_data``` which demonstrates the desired format of the data for the seasonality model. It has to have columns with names ID and EVENT_DATE. To run the seasonality model, write
```{r}
library(gseasonality)
seasonality_mod <- seasonality_gam(diagnosis_data)
```

The output of the function is of type "seasm" and ```summary``` and ```plot``` functions can be applied to it to explore and visualize the results, e.g.:
```{r}
summary(seasonality_mod)
```
and 
```{r}
plot(seasonality_mod)
```
(plot not shown).

Next, to create the seasonality phenotypes based on the seasonality model fit, we write:
```{r}
seasonality_pheno <- get_seasonality_phenotype(seasonality_mod)
head(seasonality_pheno)
```
The output is a tibble data frame containing:  
   
- ```seasonal_val_binary``` - Binary seasonality phenotype. 1 denotes that the individual was diagnosed in the season of high incidence and 0 denotes that the individual was diagnosed in the season of low incidence

- ```seasonal_val_qt``` - Continuous seasonality phenotype value. This denotes the extent of the seasonality curve when an individual is diagnosed with a disease. The phenotype has been quantile normalized.
