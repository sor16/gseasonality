\title{Run seasonality model using monthly counts data}
\usage{
seasonality_gam(
  data = NULL,
  monthly_counts = NULL,
  year_start = NULL,
  year_end = NULL,
  adjusted = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame with the diagnosis date for each individual with the disease. It should contain the columns:
\itemize{
   \item{"ID"}{ a character denoting the ID of the patient}
   \item{"EVENT_DATE"}{ character in the format YYYY-MM-DD denoting the first date the disease is recorded in the registry}
}}

\item{monthly_counts}{data.frame with the diagnosis counts per year per month. It should contain the columns:
\itemize{
   \item{"EVENT_YEAR"}{ Integer denoting the year}
   \item{"EVENT_DATE"}{ Integer denoting the month}
   \item{"COUNT"}{ Integer denoting the number of individuals diagnosed in a particular year and month}
}
Either data or monthly_counts must be provided. If both are provided, monthly_counts argument will be ignored and data used to derive the monthly_counts.}

\item{year_start}{integer denoting the starting year of the analysis.
Defaults to NULL in which case the starting year is taken to be the earliest year in data}

\item{year_end}{integer denoting the final year of the analysis.
Defaults to NULL in which case the final year is taken to be the latest year in data}

\item{adjusted}{boolean denoting whether to perform specific adjustments for months with low hospital usage (July and December). Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{...}{Not used for this function}
}
\value{
The function returns an object of type "seasm"
